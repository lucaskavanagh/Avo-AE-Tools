# Avo-AE-Tools: A collection of scripts for After Effects

## SharableSetup
This script lays out titles for a social media "sharable" video from a text file. The text file should consist of the text to be shown on screen in the video and use "/" to denote a line break and "//" to denote a slide break. No spaces should be used before or after line or page breaks. In general, keep each line under 40 characters. It also generates a citation area where footage and fact attribution may be filled in (this is optional, delete this text layer if not used).

The 1080x1080 square video will be created, with slide length porportional to the length of text displayed (10 characters per second). At this point, video files can be added under each slide (it is reommended these be precomposed with the text tiles to keep things organized). A few tips to improve the look of the text titles:
* Use Animation Composer to generate in and out transitions (recommended to use Ease Fade & Position 3 from the left hand side)
* Edit the colours of the text and background (this can be done in bulk using the character and shape fill tools respectively)
